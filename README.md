# Sanyam Khurana (aka **CuriousLearner**)
*(Pronounced: **Sah-yum Ku-ra-na** /ˈsɑː jəm ku ˈrɑː nə/)*

**Principal Engineer & Cloud Architect · Open Source Contributor (CPython, Django, DRF, Mozilla)**  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You're in luck! Immediate availability: Backend–DevOps (freelance/contract/full-time).

I'm a Principal Engineer and AWS Certified Solutions Architect with over 10 years of experience building scalable, cloud-native backend systems. I specialize in architecting high-performance infrastructure using Python, Django, Golang, AWS, and modern DevOps practices.

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science with specialization in Machine Learning and Interactive Intelligence from Georgia Institute of Technology. My journey as a "community-taught" programmer instilled in me a deep appreciation for knowledge sharing and continuous learning.

I'm passionate about Open Source. I've contributed to CPython, Django, Django REST Framework, and Mozilla projects. Ever typed `print "hello"` in Python 3 and got a helpful syntax error suggesting `Did you mean print("hello")?` That's one of my contributions to CPython; making Python's error messages more user-friendly! I was granted bug-triaging access on [bugs.python.org](https://bugs.python.org/) and I'm featured on [Mozilla Credits](https://mozilla.org/credits).

Beyond coding, I'm committed to giving back to the community. I serve as a Google Summer of Code Mentor at Debian, speak at international conferences, and mentor developers worldwide. I'm a vouched Mozillian and an active contributor to the Python and Django communities.
