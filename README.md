### Hi there 👋

#### I'm Sanyam Khurana [Pronounced as: Sah-yum  ku-ra-na (/sah jəm ku ra na/)].

You might have seen me contributing to open source projects with the name `CuriousLearner`. 
I've been contributing code to Open Source for the past eight years & some of my noticeable contributions are in 
CPython (Python's Interpreter), Django Web Framework, Django REST Framework, Mozilla's Gecko Engine, etc. 
I have also spoken at various International conferences sharing my learnings with the community at large.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Python/Django/NodeJS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript.
- 💬 Ask me anything about ML / AI / Backend Development / Public Speaking / Cloud.
- 📫 How to reach me: Sanyam@SanyamKhurana.com
- 😄 My website: https://SanyamKhurana.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you ever mistakenly use `print` in Python3 as a statement (instead of a function) and see the line `Did you mean <python3 syntax of code>`, I added that feature in Python.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- I help individuals and companies with code-reviews and stepping up their game with Python. If you want to write clean & efficient code with Python/Django/DRF or looking for tips on dev productivity with Python, please drop me an email.
